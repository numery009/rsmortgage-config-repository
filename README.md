# rsmortgage-config-repository

This repository belongs to one micro service. That's why it has only one folder "rsmortgage-customer-service". Which contains all the configuration for different enviroment of a particular micro-service.

If we want to run multiple micro services then we will create multiple folder with their properties in this repository.
